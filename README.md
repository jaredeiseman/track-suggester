## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repository
* Open 'index.html' in a browser
* Choose the answers that best suit your purpose
* Choose the next or previous buttons to navigate the survey
* When all answers are satisfactory, choose submit, enjoy the animation and read your results

## Known Bugs

When only the final question is answered in the form, and the form is submitted, validation will still work as intended to prevent the form from being completed. However, the styling added to denote unanswered questions does not colorize the final question properly after a couple of iterations through failing the validation.
